# Backend Structure Document for codeguide-quora-clone

## 1. Backend Architecture

Our backend is built on the Next.js framework, using its API Routes feature to handle all server-side logic. The core design follows a simple yet powerful flow:

- **API Routes (Next.js)** handle incoming HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  
- **Authentication Layer (Better Auth)** secures endpoints and manages user sessions.  
- **Data Access Layer (Drizzle ORM)** provides type-safe interactions with PostgreSQL.  

This setup leverages the best of server-side rendering (SSR) and API-driven design. Key benefits:

- **Scalability**: Docker containers let you spin up more instances easily. Next.js handles routing and can scale horizontally.  
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between routes, database logic, and authentication makes it easy to update or extend features.  
- **Performance**: Server components in Next.js render pages quickly on the server. Drizzle’s type-safe queries reduce runtime errors.

## 2. Database Management

We use PostgreSQL (a relational SQL database) paired with Drizzle ORM:

- PostgreSQL stores structured Q&A data reliably.  
- Drizzle ORM maps TypeScript models to SQL tables, ensuring queries match the schema exactly.  
- Drizzle Kit handles database migrations, keeping schema changes in sync across environments.

Data practices:

- **Migrations**: Version-controlled SQL migrations via Drizzle Kit.  
- **Backups**: Daily database snapshots on the managed cloud provider (e.g., AWS RDS or DigitalOcean Managed Databases).  
- **Indexing**: We add indexes on foreign keys and searchable text columns to speed up lookups.

## 3. Database Schema

Below is the SQL schema for our key tables. It’s written in standard PostgreSQL syntax:

```sql
-- Users table (from Better Auth)
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Questions table
CREATE TABLE questions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  author_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Answers table
CREATE TABLE answers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  question_id UUID REFERENCES questions(id),
  author_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Votes table (for both questions and answers)
CREATE TABLE votes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  target_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (target_type IN ('question','answer')),
  target_id UUID NOT NULL,
  vote_value SMALLINT NOT NULL CHECK (vote_value IN (1,-1)),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE (user_id, target_type, target_id)
);

-- Topics (tags) table
CREATE TABLE topics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

-- Join table between questions and topics
CREATE TABLE question_topics (
  question_id UUID REFERENCES questions(id),
  topic_id UUID REFERENCES topics(id),
  PRIMARY KEY (question_id, topic_id)
);

-- Comments table (nested discussions on answers)
CREATE TABLE comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  answer_id UUID REFERENCES answers(id),
  author_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

We follow a RESTful approach using Next.js API Routes under `/app/api`:

- **/api/auth/**: Handles sign-up, sign-in, and session management (Better Auth).  
- **/api/questions**
  - GET /api/questions: List all questions or filter by topic.  
  - POST /api/questions: Create a new question (authenticated).  
  - GET /api/questions/[id]: Fetch a single question with its answers and vote counts.  
  - PUT /api/questions/[id]: Update a question (author only).  
  - DELETE /api/questions/[id]: Remove a question (author or moderator).

- **/api/answers**
  - POST /api/answers: Add an answer to a question.  
  - PUT /api/answers/[id]: Edit an answer.  
  - DELETE /api/answers/[id]: Delete an answer.

- **/api/votes**
  - POST /api/votes: Cast or change a vote on a question or answer.  
  - DELETE /api/votes/[id]: Remove a vote.

- **/api/topics**
  - GET /api/topics: List all topics.  
  - POST /api/topics: Create a new topic (admin/moderator).

- **/api/comments**
  - POST /api/comments: Add a comment to an answer.  
  - DELETE /api/comments/[id]: Remove a comment.

Every endpoint validates input (using Zod or similar) and checks permissions via Better Auth session data.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

- **Containerized Deployment (Docker)**: Ensures consistent environments from development to production.  
- **Cloud Provider**: Deploy on platforms like Vercel (for Next.js functions) and a managed PostgreSQL service (AWS RDS, DigitalOcean).  
- **Benefits**:
  - Reliability: Managed databases offer automated backups and failover.  
  - Scalability: Docker images can be replicated behind a load balancer.  
  - Cost-effectiveness: Pay-as-you-go serverless functions (Vercel) and managed databases reduce ops overhead.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across multiple Next.js instances (e.g., AWS ELB or Vercel’s global edge network).  
- **CDN**: Vercel’s built-in CDN or CloudFront to cache static assets and server-rendered pages.  
- **Caching Layer**: Optionally use Redis for session caching or to store hot data (e.g., popular questions).  
- **Content Delivery**: Static assets (images, CSS) served via CDN for low latency.  
- **Migration Tool**: Drizzle Kit manages SQL migrations across dev, staging, and production.

## 7. Security Measures

- **Authentication**: Better Auth handles secure sign-in, sign-up, and session tokens.  
- **Authorization**: Middleware checks user roles (author, moderator, admin) before allowing edits or deletes.  
- **Input Validation**: All API payloads validated with a schema library (Zod) to prevent XSS and SQL injection.  
- **Encryption**:
  - In transit: TLS (HTTPS) on all requests.  
  - At rest: Database provider encrypts data automatically.  
- **HTTP Security**: Set secure headers (Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options) via a middleware like `helmet`.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Error Tracking**: Sentry captures runtime exceptions and performance bottlenecks.  
- **Logging**: Structured logs (JSON) sent to a central logging service (e.g., Datadog, Logflare).  
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana or a managed alternative (Datadog) for CPU, memory, request latency.  
- **Health Checks**: Automated endpoint pings to ensure API routes are responsive.  
- **Database Maintenance**: Regular vacuuming and index analysis on PostgreSQL (managed by provider).  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions runs tests, builds Docker images, and deploys on merge to main.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

This backend structure is built to support a full-featured Quora-like platform from day one. By combining Next.js API Routes, Better Auth, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL, we achieve:

- **Rapid feature development** with type-safe database access and modular API routes.  
- **High performance** through server-side rendering and CDN caching.  
- **Robust security** with validated input, encrypted channels, and role-based access.  
- **Operational simplicity** via Docker, managed cloud services, and automated monitoring.

The clear separation of concerns and use of modern tools ensures the backend can grow with user demands, handle high traffic, and keep maintenance overhead low. This setup provides a rock-solid foundation for implementing advanced features like reputation scoring, full-text search, and AI-powered recommendations in the future.
