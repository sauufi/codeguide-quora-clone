# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a starter template called **codeguide-quora-clone** for building a full-stack Q&A web platform similar to Quora. It provides a solid foundation—including user authentication, database integration, a responsive UI, and containerization—so you can focus on adding features like question posting, answering, and voting without reinventing the core infrastructure.

The key purpose is to accelerate development by offering best-practice architecture: a Next.js frontend with server-side rendering for SEO, a TypeScript-based backend with Next.js API Routes, type-safe Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL, and Docker for consistent deployments. Success will be measured by delivering a secure, performant MVP that supports user sign-up/sign-in, content CRUD, voting, topic categorization, and a clean, responsive interface.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope
**In-Scope (Version 1):**
- User sign-up, sign-in, and session management (Better Auth).
- CRUD operations for Questions and Answers via Next.js API Routes.
- Voting system (upvotes/downvotes) with duplicate-vote prevention.
- Topic/tag system (many-to-many) for categorizing questions.
- User profile pages showing a user’s questions and answers.
- Main feed/dashboard that lists recent questions sorted by vote count or recency.
- Basic filtering by topic on the feed.
- Responsive UI components (Radix UI + shadcn/ui) styled with Tailwind CSS.
- Database schema definitions and migrations using Drizzle ORM and Drizzle Kit.
- Docker configuration for local development and production builds.

**Out-of-Scope (Phase 2+):**
- Full-text search or third-party search integration (Algolia).
- Nested comments on answers (comment threads).
- Role-based moderation (admins/moderators).
- Reputation points or badges beyond simple vote counts.
- Real-time updates or WebSocket-driven feeds.
- Advanced analytics or A/B testing.

## 3. User Flow
A new visitor lands on the public home page where they can view a limited list of recent questions. They click **Sign Up**, fill out their email and password, then verify their account. Upon successful authentication, they are redirected to their personalized dashboard, which displays the main question feed and a sidebar for filtering by topic or navigating to their profile.

From the dashboard, the user can:
1. Click **Ask Question** to open a modal form.
2. Submit a title, describe the question, and optionally select or create topics.
3. View newly posted questions in the feed instantly.
4. Click on any question card to visit the question detail page, where they can read answers or post their own.
5. Upvote or downvote questions and answers via dedicated buttons. Their vote is recorded in the database, and the feed updates vote counts accordingly.

## 4. Core Features
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure sign-up/sign-in with session management; only logged-in users can post or vote.
- **Questions CRUD:** Create, read, update, and delete questions.
- **Answers CRUD:** Submit answers to questions and edit/delete your own answers.
- **Voting System:** Upvote/downvote on questions and answers; prevent duplicate votes per user per item.
- **Topic/Tag Management:** Assign multiple topics to a question; browse questions by topic.
- **User Profiles:** Dynamic pages showing a user’s questions, answers, and vote statistics.
- **Responsive UI:** Reusable components (cards, modals, forms) built with Radix UI, shadcn/ui, and styled by Tailwind CSS.
- **API Layer:** Next.js API Routes for backend logic, integrated with Better Auth for user sessions.
- **Database Schema & Migrations:** Drizzle ORM definitions for `users`, `questions`, `answers`, `votes`, and `topics` plus Drizzle Kit for migrations.
- **Containerization:** Docker files and commands for local development and production deployment.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools
**Frontend:**
- Next.js (App Router) + Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- React & TypeScript
- Radix UI + shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS v4

**Backend:**
- Next.js API Routes
- Better Auth for authentication
- Drizzle ORM (Type-safe queries)
- Drizzle Kit for database migrations
- PostgreSQL

**DevOps & Tools:**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js (v18+)
- GitHub Actions (optional CI/CD)
- Sentry for error monitoring (optional)

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** API responses under 200ms for simple queries; first contentful paint under 1 second on a standard broadband connection.
- **Scalability:** Database design should handle indexing on key fields (e.g., question ID, topic ID) to support growth.
- **Security:** Protect against XSS and SQL injection via Zod validation on inputs; enforce HTTPS; secure cookies for sessions.
- **Usability:** Responsive layout supporting desktop and mobile; accessible form labels and keyboard navigation.
- **Maintainability:** 80% code coverage on business-critical modules; clear folder structure and modular components.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions
- **Environment:** Assumes Docker support and a PostgreSQL service available.
- **Libraries:** Better Auth and Drizzle must support the chosen Node.js version.
- **Team Skillset:** Familiarity with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Scope Stability:** Core features will not expand significantly in v1 to avoid scope creep.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls
- **Duplicate Vote Handling:** Must enforce database constraints or application checks to prevent multiple votes from the same user. Use unique compound index on `(userId, itemId, itemType)`.
- **Input Validation:** Missing or weak validation can lead to XSS attacks. Mitigation: Use Zod schemas for all API inputs.
- **SEO Considerations:** Client-side navigation may hide dynamic routes from crawlers. Mitigation: Leverage Next.js SSR for public question pages.
- **Database Migrations Drift:** Without strict processes, dev and prod schemas may diverge. Mitigation: Integrate Drizzle Kit migration checks into CI.
- **Responsive Edge Cases:** Complex components (e.g., multi-select for topics) may not render well on small screens. Mitigation: Test on common device breakpoints early.
