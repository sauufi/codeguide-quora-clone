# Security Guidelines for codeguide-quora-clone

This document provides a comprehensive set of security best practices tailored to the `codeguide-quora-clone` starter kit. It applies to all phases of development, testing, and deployment, ensuring your Q&A platform is built securely by design.

---

## 1. Core Security Principles

1. **Security by Design**: Integrate security reviews at every stage—design, coding, testing, and deployment.  
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant each component or service only the permissions it absolutely needs.  
3. **Defense in Depth**: Layer controls (network, application, data) so that if one fails, others remain.  
4. **Fail Securely**: Ensure errors do not expose sensitive data or leave resources in an unsafe state.  
5. **Secure Defaults**: Default configurations should prioritize security over convenience.

## 2. Authentication & Access Control

### 2.1. User Authentication
- Use a proven authentication library (e.g., Better Auth).  
- Enforce strong password policies: minimum 12 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols.  
- Hash passwords with Argon2 or bcrypt and a unique per-user salt.  
- Do not store plaintext secrets in code or environment files—use a secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

### 2.2. Session Management
- Store session identifiers in secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookies.  
- Enforce idle and absolute session timeouts (e.g., 15 min idle, 24 hr absolute).  
- Invalidate sessions on logout, password change, or suspicious activity.  
- Protect against session fixation by rotating session IDs after authentication.

### 2.3. Multi-Factor & Role-Based Access
- Offer optional MFA (TOTP or SMS) for sensitive actions (e.g., moderation).  
- Define clear roles (User, Moderator, Admin) and enforce server-side RBAC on every API route.  
- Reject unauthorized requests with HTTP 403, avoiding detailed error messages.

## 3. Input Validation & Output Encoding

### 3.1. API Input Validation
- Use a schema validation library (e.g., Zod) on every Next.js API route.  
- Reject or sanitize unexpected fields; whitelist permissible properties only.  
- Enforce length, type, format, and pattern constraints on user-supplied data.

### 3.2. Preventing Injection Attacks
- Use Drizzle ORM’s parameterized queries—never interpolate raw strings into SQL.  
- Sanitize any dynamic file paths or OS commands to prevent path or command injection.  
- Validate and normalize redirect targets against an allow-list.

### 3.3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Escape or encode all user content before rendering in React.  
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; if required, sanitize input with a library like DOMPurify.  
- Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) via HTTP headers.

---

## 4. API & Service Security

- **HTTPS Only**: Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all client and microservice communication.  
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttle write-heavy or auth endpoints to mitigate brute-force and DoS.  
- **CORS**: Restrict origins to trusted domains (e.g., your production and staging URLs).  
- **Versioning**: Prefix API routes (e.g., `/api/v1/questions`) to safely introduce changes.

---

## 5. Web Application Hardening

### 5.1. Security Headers
- Strict-Transport-Security: `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`  
- Content-Security-Policy: Restrict scripts, styles, images to trusted sources.  
- X-Frame-Options: `DENY`  
- X-Content-Type-Options: `nosniff`  
- Referrer-Policy: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### 5.2. CSRF Protection
- Implement CSRF tokens (e.g., same-site cookie + header token) on state-changing POST/PUT/DELETE routes.

### 5.3. Secure Client Storage
- Avoid storing PII or tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.  
- If needed, use HttpOnly cookies for JWT or session tokens.

## 6. Data Protection & Privacy

- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all traffic.  
- **Encryption at Rest**: Enable database-level encryption or disk encryption (AES-256).  
- **PII Handling**: Collect only necessary data, mask or redact sensitive fields in logs.  
- **Secret Management**: Use dedicated vault solutions; rotate keys regularly.

---

## 7. Database Security

- Create a dedicated PostgreSQL user with **only** required privileges (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).  
- Enable SSL connections and reject non-TLS clients.  
- Isolate migrations: use Drizzle Kit for controlled, versioned schema changes.  
- Regularly back up and test restore procedures.

---

## 8. Dependency & Build Management

- Pin exact versions in `package.json` and maintain `package-lock.json`.  
- Regularly scan with SCA tools (Snyk, Dependabot, GitHub Advanced Security).  
- Audit third-party UI components (Radix, shadcn/ui) for vulnerabilities before upgrade.

---

## 9. Containerization & Infrastructure

- Build images with multi-stage Dockerfiles; run app as non-root.  
- Remove build-time tools and debug flags in production images.  
- Limit exposed ports; use an internal network for microservices.  
- Perform regular OS and library updates; scan images for known CVEs.

---

## 10. Monitoring, Logging & Incident Response

- Integrate error monitoring (Sentry) and alert on high-severity exceptions.  
- Log authentication events, failed validations, and rate-limit triggers.  
- Scrub logs of PII; store logs in a centralized, access-controlled system.  
- Develop an incident response plan: detection, containment, eradication, recovery.

---

## 11. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

- Enforce code reviews focusing on security.  
- Incorporate automated security tests into CI/CD (linting, SAST, DAST).  
- Maintain a vulnerability disclosure policy for third-party researchers.

By adhering to these guidelines, you will ensure your Q&A platform remains robust against common and advanced threats, delivering a secure experience to your users from development through production.
